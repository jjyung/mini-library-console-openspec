# AGENTS

Version: 1.0.1
Last Updated: 2026-03-04

This file defines mandatory rules for AI Agents and developers.
All generated code MUST comply with this document.

---

## Global Rules

### UI Test Locator Integrity (MUST)

- All UI changes MUST preserve `data-testid` integrity.

- If QA raises locator requirements, PG MUST prioritize handling them.

### Skill-Agent Decoupling (MUST)

- Skill files under `.codex/skills/**` MUST NOT depend on `.codex/agents/*.toml`.
- Skill workflow/checklist content MUST be self-contained and MUST NOT require reading agent config files as inputs.
- Existing agents may remain for runtime/persona usage, but skills MUST work correctly when agent files are absent.
- New or updated skills MUST follow the same rule and MUST NOT add references to `.codex/agents/**`.

---

## Java Backend Rules

### Naming

#### MUST

- No `_` or `$` at start or end of identifiers

- No Chinese naming

- No Pinyin-English mixed naming

- No discriminatory words (use allowList / blockList)

#### Class

- UpperCamelCase

- Abstract class: prefix `Abstract` or `Base`

- Exception class: suffix `Exception`

- Test class: `ClassNameTest`

#### Method / Variable

- lowerCamelCase

- No single-letter variable names

- Use meaningful names

#### Constant

- UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE

- No magic values

- long must use `L`

- float/double must use `F` / `D`

#### Enum

- Class name suffix `Enum`

- Members UPPER_CASE

#### Service / DAO

- getXxx → single object

- listXxx → multiple objects

- countXxx → count

- Implementation class suffix `Impl`

#### Other

- Array declaration: `int[] array`

- Boolean field in POJO MUST NOT start with `is`

---

### OOP

#### MUST

- All fields `private`

- Provide getter/setter

- No calling overridable methods in constructor

- Avoid deep inheritance

- Prefer composition

- Single Responsibility Principle

- Method parameter count ≤ 5

- Use interface + polymorphism

- Avoid large if-else for business logic

---

### Exception Handling

#### MUST

- No empty catch

- No catching `Exception` or `Throwable` directly

- All exceptions must be handled or declared

- Preserve original exception when wrapping

- Log with stack trace

- Use try-with-resources for resource handling

Example:

```java
throw new MyBusinessException("message", e);
```

---

### Error Code

All APIs MUST return business error code.

| Code | Type |
| --- | --- |
| 00000 | Success |
| A0000 | Client Error |
| B0000 | System Error |
| C0000 | Third-party Error |

HTTP status code MUST NOT replace business error code.

---

## Frontend Rules

---

### Naming

#### MUST

- Use camelCase for variables and functions

- Use PascalCase for components

- No Chinese naming

- No Pinyin-English mixed naming

Example:

- BookListPage

- fetchBooks

- userProfileStore

---

### Component Structure

#### MUST

- One component per file

- File name MUST match component name

- Component MUST have single responsibility

- Avoid business logic inside UI component

Business logic MUST be placed in:

- service layer

- composable / hook

- store

---

### API Calling Rules

#### MUST

- All API calls MUST use centralized API client

- No direct fetch/axios inside component

- API path MUST match OpenAPI definition

- Model MUST align with `{HttpMethod}{Resource}RequestDTO/ResponseDTO`

Example:

- GetBooksResponseDTO must match backend response schema

---

### State Management

#### MUST

- No global mutable variable

- Use store (Pinia / Redux / equivalent)

- Store must separate:

  - state

  - action

  - getter

---

### Error Handling

#### MUST

- All API errors MUST map to backend business error code

- No direct error message display without mapping

- UI must not depend on HTTP status only

---

### DTO Alignment

#### MUST

- Frontend model MUST match OpenAPI schema

- No manual field renaming without adapter layer

- If transformation needed, use mapper function

---

### Forbidden

- No hard-coded API URL

- No magic number

- No duplicated API logic

- No direct business rule inside UI template

---

### Figma UI Alignment

#### MUST

- Frontend implementation MUST align with design references under `docs/figma/*`.

- `docs/figma/*` MAY contain multiple requirement batches and segmented screens; FE MUST follow the target requirement's corresponding Figma folder(s).

- When visual/style conflicts exist across different `docs/figma/*` batches, FE MUST follow the latest requirement-scoped Figma source and document the chosen reference in delivery notes.

- UI alignment MUST NOT break existing `data-testid` locators.

---

## OpenAPI Contract Rules

This section applies to Backend, Frontend, SA, QA.

---

### API ID (MUST)

Each API MUST have a unique API ID.

Format:

```text
{service-name}-{resource-name-plural}-{3-digit-seq}

```

Rules:

- service-name: lowercase kebab-case

- resource-name: plural

- sequence: 001-999

- must be unique within same service-resource group

Example:

- library-books-001

- member-users-013

Usage:

- API ID MUST appear in API name

- API ID MUST NOT be used as operationId

---

### operationId (MUST)

- operationId MUST use path

- Must align with Stoplight maintenance style

- MUST NOT use API ID as operationId

---

### Model Naming (MUST)

All models MUST distinguish Request and Response.

Format:

```text
{HttpMethod}{ResourcePlural}RequestDTO
{HttpMethod}{ResourcePlural}ResponseDTO

```

HttpMethod:

- Get

- Post

- Put

- Patch

- Delete

Examples:

- GetBooksRequestDTO

- PostBooksResponseDTO

- PatchUsersRequestDTO

---

### Naming Conflict (SHOULD)

When conflict occurs, add qualifier:

- Admin

- Internal

- Public

- Summary

- Detail

- V2

Example:

- GetBooksDetailResponseDTO

- PostAdminBooksRequestDTO

---

## Git Rules

### Branch Naming

Format:

```text
category/issueId-description

```

Category:

- hotfix

- bugfix

- feature

- test

- wip

Rules:

- Must include issue ID

- Must not be number-only

- Keep short

- Be consistent

---

### Commit Message

Format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

```

Types:

- feat

- fix

- docs

- style

- refactor

- perf

- test

- chore

- revert

Rules:

- subject ≤ 50 characters

- each body line ≤ 72 characters

- explain why and impact

- include issue in footer

---

## Versioning (Semantic Versioning)

Format:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

```

Rules:

- MAJOR → incompatible API changes

- MINOR → backward compatible feature

- PATCH → backward compatible fix

- No leading zero

- Released version MUST NOT be modified

Pre-release:

- alpha

- beta

- rc

Example:

- 1.0.0

- 1.1.0

- 2.0.0

- 1.0.0-alpha

- 1.0.0-rc.1
